<h1>Threepp Excavator</h1>
Threepp Excavator is a very small demo whose purpose is to show up some basic understanding of object oriented programming. The demo features randomly generated gold coins aswell as a castle with some dirt blocking the entrance. The dirt can be shoveled using the excavator and dumped in a nearby area, (i was supposed to make a 10 coin requirement for a door underneath the dirt but i forgot).
<h2>Controlls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>WASD is used as expected</li>
  <li>Q/E is used to rotate the turret</li>
  <li>R/F is used  to rotate the boom</li>
  <li>T/G is used to rotate the stick</li>
  <li>Y/H is used to rotate the bucket</li>
  <li>P is used to restart the program</li>
</ul>  

<h2>Features</h2>
The program can load 3d-models, simulate excavator movement with acceleration, deceleration and individual trackspeeds. It can interact with different objects aswell as play sound based on things like speed and objects picked up aswell as a adjustable master volume bar.
