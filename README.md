<h1>Threepp Excavator</h1>
Threepp Excavator is a very small demo whose purpose is to show up some basic understanding of object oriented programming. The demo features randomly generated gold coins aswell as a castle with some dirt blocking the entrance. The dirt can be shoveled using the excavator and dumped in a nearby area, (i was supposed to make a 10 coin requirement for a door underneath the dirt but i forgot).
<h2>Controlls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>WASD is used as expected</li>
  <li>Q/E is used to rotate the turret</li>
  <li>R/F is used  to rotate the boom</li>
  <li>T/G is used to rotate the stick</li>
  <li>Y/H is used to rotate the bucket</li>
  <li>P is used to restart the program</li>
</ul>  

<h2>Features</h2>
The program can load 3d-models, simulate excavator movement with acceleration, deceleration and individual trackspeeds. It can interact with different objects aswell as play sound based on things like speed and objects picked up aswell as a adjustable master volume bar.

Settings is used in most things as it serves as an easy way for me to change values while coding. The input manager is used by the main program.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Throughout this project i felt like it kinda turned away from the creative fun project i was doing into a chore which i do think negatively affected my work. I had a lot of fun working on the interactions inbetween the different parts of the excavator and figure out how to get it working propperly while closer to the end it became more of a oh add another thing to satisfy the requirements over and over. I really enjoyed working out the physical problems like how to get the tracks to move. Thats the main reason why i wanted to make a excavator instead of a car like everyone else. I could make the animation a lot smoother by adding more models that are closer together as right now theres just 3 different animations. I think toward the end i ended up looking up way more and thinking less when i came upon problems, that kinda snowballed. 

<h2>Improvements</h2>
There is a LOT to improve on here. First of all i think as i got lazier with my coding it also got less and less optimized and way more code. Other than that the error handeling is probably obysmal. There was quite many errors i let copilot fix without fully understanding which came back to bite me in the butt. Finally i should probably add the unlockable gate (whcich i forgot) aswell as better audio integration including things like collision, scooping and dumping of materials. If it were to be played as an actual mini-game some explanatory UI should also be added, for example pop ups/guides telling you how the controlls work, i think it could function pretty well as a tutorial for a bigger game.
